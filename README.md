=============

This library processes strings with GSS stylesheets and extracts the rules of different languages to their own groups that can be then processed separately. GSS includes the following sub-languages:

* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
* CCSS - Constraint Cascading Style Sheets
* GTL - Grid Template Language
* VFL - Visual Format Language
