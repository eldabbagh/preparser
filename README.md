This library processes strings with GSS stylesheets and extracts the rules of different languages to their own groups that can be then processed separately. GSS includes the following sub-languages:

* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
* [CCSS](https://github.com/the-gss/ccss-compiler#readme) - Constraint Cascading Style Sheets
* [GTL](https://github.com/the-gss/gtl-compiler#readme) - Grid Template Language
* [VFL](https://github.com/the-gss/vfl-compiler#readme) - Visual Format Language
